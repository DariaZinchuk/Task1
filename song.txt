I never thought I could forget you,
I never thought I'd be the man I am now,
It's 20 seconds since I left you,
Cause I could never be your lover,
I found another girl to mess me 'round,
So you don't get to make me suffer,
Look into my eyes there's really nothing left to lose,
But I know that I'm never coming back to you
Love goes cold,
Blood, tears and gold,
Wont make it any better,
I never let you down baby, baby,
I never let you down baby, baby,
And it wont get any better,
Blood, tears and gold
